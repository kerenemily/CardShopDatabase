| Titan Games CU | [723 S Neil St, Champaign, IL, United States, Illinois](http://maps.apple.com/?address=723+S+Neil+St,Champaign,Illinois) | [Web](https://www.facebook.com/TitanGamesCU/) | | Test Review | (217) 607-2317 | Test Notes |
|Robin's Nest| | | 4 | Rockford, IL, very good selection of pokemon, yugioh, magic, lots of newer cards for completing sets, alphabetically sorted, popular pokemon in cases, very good organization, friendly staff, price with discounts, looked up on tcg and gave discounts based on that/owner was the best for customer service, hour away from Chicago, magic and yugioh, she also had older sets, best singles, seasled products, negotiable on prices | ||
| Top Cut Comics | older issue and high quality issue comics, cards wise: wasn't the best for singles, store showcases were better, they had $1/$2 cards but the customer service was not very good, only owner cared about customers, asked about dark tyranitar which was creased but no negotiation and not talking about other cards that might have been available, 2 stars, probably better for comics, decent selection for sealed product, non negotiable pricing
| There's Fun in Store | Dixon, Illinois | Nice selection for sealed product, talked to owner of the store, note: asked for singles, only shown graded cards, slabs, open for trades even though it is not a usual practice, overall was nice to see graded cards, not up to date on most product, 3 stars, good customer service but sadly no singles, pretty firm on pricing, amenable for trade due to trading old games for pokemon|
